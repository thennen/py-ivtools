class TeoSystem(object):
    '''
    Class for control of Teo Systems Memory Tester
    TEO: Name=TS_MemoryTester SN=201428 Rev=2.4

    TODO: put specs and basic explanation of what the system does here
    fixed 500 MSamples/s sample rate for internal AWG and ADCs
    +-10V output voltage amplitude, with 14 bit resolution (~5 mV), 50 ohm output
    rise/fall time < 1 ns
    ADC has 12 bit resolution
    ADC memory is 256 MSamples per channel
    ADC bandwidth is about 200 MHz

    designed for minimum DUT resistance 1kÎ©, but shouldn't break easily if there is a short circuit

    COM objects directly exposed:
    DriverID
    DeviceID
    DeviceControl
    LF_Measurement
    HF_Measurement
    HF_Gain
    AWG_WaveformManager

    Brings some of the most used methods that are inconveniently deep
    in the object tree to the top level and gives them shorter names

    Most of the functions I add start with a lowercase letter.
    All of TEOs functions are CapitalCamelCased, sometimes with underscores.

    Adds content-addressability of waveforms for effortless replay

    Seems to handle re-initialization just fine.
    You can make two instances and they will both work


    # TODO: does the class need to store any internal state?  should we make it BORG?

    # TODO: write high level methods (e.g. pulse_and_capture..)

    # TODO: only voltage amplitude is used for the hash, maybe we should hash the triggers as well

    # TODO: how can we be aware of the TEO memory state?  do we care?

    # TODO: TEO remembers waveforms that you upload by name
            this is to minimize unecessary data transfer, which takes time
            we should also have this class remember the waveforms in a similar way (done)
            would be useful then to also have a method that synchronizes the memories

    # TODO: methods to read the waveforms back that are already on TEO memory? (done)
            but is there a way to read the triggers back?

    # TODO: figure out what the gain really does and document it
            at what voltage does the ADC saturate vs gain?

    # TODO: do all the commands work regardless of which mode we are in? e.g. waveform upload, gain setting

    # TODO: what happens when we send commands while the board is busy?

    # TODO: my understanding is that there is an idle voltage level set by
            LF_Measurement.LF_Voltage.SetValue(DClevel)
            is this always applied when a waveform is not playing? (yes)
            does that mean the instrument switches into LF mode when a waveform is not playing? (no)

    # TODO: there are apparently restrictions on what size samples you should send to the AWG
            there's a chunk size or something. e.g. 1024 plays fine but anything below that seems broken
            we need code that pads arrays that don't conform to the right chunk size
            Teo said that they need to be padded to a multiple of 2048
            but that his software/firmware is supposed to do it for you
            but there are bugs (try very short waveforms)

    # TODO: could wrap some of the functions only for the purpose of giving them signatures, docstrings,
            default arguments.

    # TODO: should we hide the entire COM interface in a container?  like
            self.com.DeviceControl, self.com.LF_Measurement etc
            then on the top level we have mostly stuff that we have defined that has docstrings and
            so on, but we can still access the com interface if needed.

            downside is that when we ask for support our code will be unrecognizable to Teo.
            therefore:
    # TODO: should we have some kind of a debug mode that prints out all the COM calls?


    # TODO: since there seem to be a lot of situations that cause the output to go to the negative rail
            and blow up your device, document them here
            seems to be whenever TSX_DM.exe connects to the system
            1. on first initialization (Dispatch('TSX_HMan'))
            2. if you disconnect USB and plug it back in

    # TODO: should we store a calibration to remove the offsets? monitor has a big offset and for
            the other channel it depends a bit on the gain setting.
